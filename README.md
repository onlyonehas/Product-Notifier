# ‚ö°Ô∏è Product Notifier

Product Notifier is a script that monitors product prices and sends notifications via Telegram. It leverages Node.js to make HTTP requests, utilizes Cheerio for HTML parsing, and interacts with the Telegram API for sending notifications.

## üåü Features

- Monitors the price of products.
- Stores the monitored data in a JSON file.
- Sends price change notifications via Telegram.
- Prevents redundant monitoring by checking if the data has already been processed for the day.

## üîß Prerequisites

- Node.js (Version 18 or higher)
- AWS account and AWS CLI configured

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script files to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script files are located.
3. Install the dependencies by running the following command:
``` npm install ```
4. Create a `config.json` file in the root directory with the following structure:

```
{
"telegramBotToken": "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN",
"telegramChatId": "YOUR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID"
}
```

Replace `YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` with your actual Telegram bot token and `YOUR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` with your actual Telegram chat ID.

5. Save the changes in the `config.json` file.

## üí° Usage

1. Open the `products.json` file in a text editor.
2. Define the products you want to monitor in the following format:

```json
[
  {
    "productUrl": "PRODUCT_URL",
    "desiredPrice": DESIRED_PRICE,
    "monitorEnabled": true
  },
  ...
]
```

3. Replace PRODUCT_URL with the URL of the product you want to monitor, DESIRED_PRICE with the desired price, and set monitorEnabled to true to enable monitoring for that product.

4. Save the changes in the data.json file.
5. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script files are located.
6. Run the script using the following command:
```
npm start
```

The script will monitor the product prices and send notifications via Telegram when there are price changes.
